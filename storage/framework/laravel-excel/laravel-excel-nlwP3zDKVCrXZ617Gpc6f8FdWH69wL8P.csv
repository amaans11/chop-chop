Grab the spatula/spoonula and, in small circular motions, distribute the onions, chile, and cilantro evenly around the pan. This also helps move some of the uncooked egg down to the surface of the hot pan. Cover and cook for 2 1/2 minutes.  
3\. Grab a plate that's as big as your pan. Pull off the lid and look at your omelet. It might still look a little runny, but it shouldn't be super runny. If it is, then cover and cook 1 more minute.  
4\. Slide the omelet, cooked side down, onto your plate. Then, holding the plate from underneath, put your pan over your plate, and flip so that the uncooked side lands on the pan. Cook, uncovered, another minute.

It’s also a great way to revive leftover rice the next day. (See Cook’s Note)",30,15,Easy,,"1 cup basmati rice,
1 1/2 cups vegetable stock or water ,
1 teaspoon ground turmeric ,
Kosher salt ,
2 tablespoon ghee, coconut oil or olive oil ,
1 teaspoon brown mustard seeds ,
1/4 cup peanuts or broken cashew nuts  ,
1 tablespoon split white urad dal , 
1/2 teaspoon asafetida  ,
1/2 teaspoon crushed red chiles , 
10 to 15 fresh curry leaves (see Cook’s Note) ,
1 lemon, zested and juiced 
","1\. Wash the rice in cold water until the water is no longer cloudy, 3 or 4 times, then drain. This step is important as it removes the starch from the rice and prevents it from clumping up.
2\. Heat the stock or water in a heavy pan with a tight-fitting lid. Add the turmeric, 1/4 teaspoon salt and the drained rice. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low, cover and cook for 15 minutes. Do not disturb the rice or take a peek while it’s in the middle of cooking. Turn off the heat and let it sit, covered, for another 5 to 7 minutes.  
3\. Meanwhile, heat the ghee or oil in a pan large enough to fit the rice over medium-high heat. Add the mustard seeds and let sizzle until you hear popping sounds, about 30 seconds. Add the nuts and cook until golden brown and crunchy, about 2 minutes. Lower the heat to medium and add the urad dal, asafetida, crushed red chiles and curry leaves. Be careful as the curry leaves might sputter. Cook until the urad dal turn golden brown, about 3 minutes. Gently mix in the cooked rice. 
4\. Remove from the heat and add the lemon zest and 2 tablespoons of the lemon juice. Taste and add more salt and lemon juice if needed.  
5\. Cook’s Note: Curry leaves are an important part of this recipe; however, if you don’t have access to fresh curry leaves, you can add some fresh herbs at the end, such as cilantro, mint, parsley or dill. If using leftover rice, add the turmeric after the dal turns golden brown and let it cook for a few seconds before adding the rice. Mix gently, cover and cook for 5 minutes before removing from the heat and adding the lemon zest, juice and salt."

3 garlic cloves finely grated,
2 tablespoons chopped fresh oregano,
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper,
2 scallions, sliced,
1/4 cup roughly chopped fresh dill","1\. To spatchcock the chicken, use strong kitchen scissors or poultry shears and cut down either side of the spine. Pull out the spine, turn the chicken over and press down on the breast of the chicken to flatten it out to one thickness. 
2\. Whisk together the olive oil, lemon juice and zest, garlic, oregano, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in a medium bowl. Put the chicken in a gallon-size resealable plastic bag in a rimmed dish. Pour in half of the marinade, reserving the rest for serving later. Seal the bag and rotate it around to evenly distribute the marinade. Refrigerate for 1 hour. 
3\. Remove the chicken from the marinade and discard the marinade. Pat the chicken dry with paper towels and season generously all over with salt and pepper; let sit at room temperature for 30 minutes. 
4\. Prepare a grill for medium indirect heat: For gas grills (with 3 or more burners), turn all the burners to mediumhigh heat; after about 15 minutes turn off one of the middle burners and turn the remaining burners down to medium. For charcoal grills, bank one chimney starterfull of lit and ashed-over charcoal briquettes to one side of the grill. Set up a drip pan on the other side to avoid flareups. (Be sure to consult the grill manufacturer's guide for best results.) 
5\. Place the chicken skin-side up on the indirect side of the grill with the legs facing the hotter side. Cover and cook until an instant-read thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the thigh (avoiding the bone) reads 150 to 160 degrees F (almost cooked through), about 50 minutes. 
6\. Move the chicken over to the direct-heat side of the grill. After 2 minutes, flip the chicken to char and crisp up the skin side, another 3 or 4 minutes. Check that the temperature in the thigh is now at least 165 degrees F. If it is not, then move the chicken back to the indirect side, cover and cook until the final temperature is reached. Remove from the grill; let rest 20 minutes before carving. 
7\. Stir the scallions and dill into the reserved marinade. Drizzle over the chicken or serve on the side.

2\. Thaw the spinach in the microwave in a microwave-safe dish, 5 minutes on high, then puree in a food processor until smooth. Alternatively, you can chop it up very finely with your knife. 
3\. Place a large nonstick skillet over medium heat, and add the paneer as the pan warms. In a couple of minutes give the pan a toss; each piece of paneer should be browned on one side. Fry another minute or so, and then remove the paneer from the pan onto a plate. 
4\. Add the remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons oil to the pan. Add the onions, ginger, garlic and chile. Now here's the important part: saute the mixture until it's evenly toffee-coloured, which should take about 15 minutes. Don't skip this step - this is the foundation of the dish! If you feel like the mixture is drying out and burning, add a couple of tablespoons of water. 
5\. Add the garam masala, coriander and cumin. If you haven't already, sprinkle a little water to keep the spices from burning. Cook, stirring often, until the raw scent of the spices cook out, and it all smells a bit more melodious, 3 to 5 minutes. 
6\. Add the spinach and stir well, incorporating the spiced onion mixture into the spinach. Add a little salt and 1/2 cup of water, stir, and cook about 5 minutes with the lid off. Turn the heat off. Add the yogurt, a little at a time to keep it from curdling.

1 packet boneless skinless chicken thighs (1 1/2 pounds usually),
1 teaspoon honey,
Salt and freshly ground black pepper,m
Couple of extra limes, for garnish","1\. To make the marinade, toast the cloves, whole chiles, both types of cardamom seeds, coriander seeds, fennel seeds and fenugreek seeds in a cast-iron skillet until fragrant, 3 minutes or so, shaking the pan. Then, pour the spices into a spice grinder and grind them until you get a fine powder. 
2\. In large bowl, whisk together the spice mixture you just made with the yogurt, oil, malt vinegar, salt, ground cinnamon, paprika, turmeric, cayenne pepper, garlic and ginger until well combined. It should smell amazing! Taste and adjust with more salt if it needs it. 
3\. Reserve 1/3 cup of the marinade and set aside; you're going to make a sauce out of this reserved marinade. 
4\. Prick the chicken thighs with a fork. Add the thighs to the rest of the marinade, and toss to coat. Marinate at least 1 hour in the fridge, and at most overnight. 
5\. When you're ready to cook, line a baking sheet with foil, and turn your broiler on. Place each chicken thigh on the baking sheet, making sure each one is coated with the marinade, but isn't swimming in it. Cook the chicken thighs under the broiler until starting to blacken, about 5 minutes. Then turn the oven to 350, and cook until a meat thermometer inserted in the meatiest part of the thigh registers 160 degrees F, another 10 minutes. Remove from the oven. 
6\. While the chicken is cooking, pour the reserved marinade into a small saucepan, along with 1/2 cup water and the honey. Bring to a gentle boil over medium-low heat, whisking all the time. Taste and season with salt and pepper. Remove from the heat and pour into a small bowl or gravy boat for serving. 
7\. Serve the chicken thighs on a platter with a fresh squeeze of lime and a drizzle of the sauce. Paneer: Homemade Indian Cheese:
Yield: Makes 12 ounces of cheese.
8\. Line a large colander with a large double layer of cheesecloth, and set it in your sink. 
9\. In a large wide pot, bring the milk to a gentle boil over medium heat, stirring frequently to avoid burning the bottom (a nonstick pot works really well for this purpose). This will take a little while so be patient! 
10\. Add the lemon juice and turn the heat down to low. Stirring gently, you should almost immediately see the curds (white milk solids) and whey (the greenish liquid) separate. Don't fret, this is perfect! 
11\. Remove the pot from the heat and carefully pour the contents into the cheesecloth-lined colander. Gently rinse with cool water to get rid of the lemon flavor. At this point, you could squeeze out some of the liquid, and serve with some honey and some nuts, almost like a fresh ricotta! 
12\. Grab the ends of the cheesecloth and twist the ball of cheese to squeeze out the excess whey. Tie the cheesecloth to your kitchen faucet and allow the cheese to drain for about 5 minutes.
13\. Twisting the ball to compact the cheese into a block, place it on a plate with the twisted part of the cheesecloth on the side (this will ensure your block of cheese is nice and smooth!) and set another plate on top. Weigh the second plate down with cans of beans or a heavy pot. Move to the refrigerator and let it sit about 20 minutes.
Aarti's Hot (not heavy!) Homemade Garam Masala:
Yield: about 1/2 cup.
14\. Combine the cinnamon sticks, cloves, green cardamom seeds, black cardamom seeds, if using into a spice grinder or coffee grinder and grind until fine. Store the spice mix in an airtight container away from direct sunlight.
Cook’s Note
*Paneer is very easy to make at home, and my recipe is quick, easy, and delicious. I also think homemade has a better texture than anything store-bought. If you'd like to buy it, this cheese is available in better supermarkets as well as specialty Asian markets. *If the milk doesn't separate juice some more lemons and add another tablespoon or two. Boost the heat again and the milk should separate. Stir in a motion that gathers the curds together rather than breaks them up."

There's a delicate dance with the noodles because they cook in three stages. First you soak them in warm water and they begin to absorb and soften. They first get pan-fried with all the ingredients. Be patient at this stage. Allow them to begin to yield and marry with the hot oil and other ingredients. Once they look soft enough to eat right out of the pan but slightly al dente, add the sauce to finish the cooking. My family was among the first to introduce this dish to America nearly 50 years ago and the American version differs slightly from the native one. The super bright orange was accentuated with paprika instead of the traditional addition of chili paste to give it a slight tint. And we typically finish this dish with garlic chives vs. green onions. I always say Pad Thai is like pancakes.

There's a delicate dance with the noodles because they cook in three stages. First you soak them in warm water and they begin to absorb and soften. They first get pan-fried with all the ingredients. Be patient at this stage. Allow them to begin to yield and marry with the hot oil and other ingredients. Once they look soft enough to eat right out of the pan but slightly al dente, add the sauce to finish the cooking. My family was among the first to introduce this dish to America nearly 50 years ago and the American version differs slightly from the native one. The super bright orange was accentuated with paprika instead of the traditional addition of chili paste to give it a slight tint. And we typically finish this dish with garlic chives vs. green onions. I always say Pad Thai is like pancakes. You'll burn a few before you get the knack for it.",45,15,Intermediate,,"Pad Thai Sauce:,
4 tablespoons (60 ml) Thai fish sauce,
4 tablespoons (50 g) sugar ,
3 tablespoons (45 ml) bottled tamarind paste ,
1 tablespoon (15 ml) fresh lime juice ,
1 tablespoon (15 ml) unseasoned rice wine vinegar ,
1 tablespoon sweet paprika, for color (optional) ,
2 teaspoons chili sauce, such as Sriracha ,
Pad Thai:,
3 to 4 cups medium-width rice sticks, soaked,
Banana leaf, cut into circles, for plating (optional) ,
2 tablespoons (30 ml) vegetable oil, such as canola, grapeseed or peanut oil ,
3 to 4 cloves garlic, roughly chopped ,
1/2 cup (95 g) Thai-style baked tofu, sliced  ,
1 teaspoon dried shrimp ,
1/2 cup (95 g) chicken, cut into thin strips, 1-inch lengths, 
2 large eggs ,
4 teaspoons packaged salted turnip, minced, 
8 shrimp, peeled and cleaned,
1 cup (240 g) bean sprouts,
1/4 cup (50 g) dry-roasted unsalted peanuts, crushed, 
3 to 4 garlic chives (or scallions), cut into 2-inch lengths on a bias, 
1 lime, cut for garnish 
","For the Pad Thai Sauce: 
1\. In a small bowl, stir together the fish sauce, sugar, tamarind paste, lime juice, vinegar, paprika and chili sauce. Set aside. 
2\. For the Pad Thai: Soak the noodles in enough warm water to cover for 1 hour.  
3\. If using, cut the banana leaf into round shapes using an overturned bowl. Place on the serving platter and hold for plating. 
4\. Heat a large cast-iron skillet over high heat. Add the oil and coat the skillet completely. When the skillet starts to smoke, add the garlic and cook, stirring, for 5 seconds. Add the tofu and dried shrimp and cook, stirring, until they begin to soften, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the chicken pieces and cook, stirring, until no longer pink, 1 to 2 minutes.  
5\. Push ingredients in the skillet to one side and let the oil settle in the center of skillet. Crack the eggs into the oil and let set until half-cooked, about 30 seconds, then lightly scramble. Combine with the remaining cooked ingredients in the skillet, scraping the bits from the bottom before they burn. Add 3 cups of the drained noodles and cook, stirring, until softened, 2 to 3 minutes. Reserve the noodle soaking water. 
6\. Add the salted turnip and shrimp. Cook until both the chicken and shrimp are at medium doneness, about 1 minute. Add the sauce and fold together until all the liquid is absorbed, about 2 minutes.   
7\. Place half of the bean sprouts, half of the crushed peanuts and the garlic chives (or scallions) in the center of noodles, and then spoon some noodles over them to cover and let steam for 30 seconds. If the skillet seems dry, add a small amount of the noodle soaking water. Transfer to a serving plate with the banana leaf circle, and garnish with the remaining bean sprouts, peanuts and lime."

I tried it both with traditional Indian jaggery and with panela, the Latin version of jaggery, and I have to say I almost preferred it with panela.

1/2 cup firmly packed jaggery, panela or other unrefined sugar (see Cook's Note),
1/2 teaspoon cardamom seeds crushed,
2 cups desiccated unsweetened, shredded coconut shavings,
Pinch of fine salt","1\. Combine the coconut milk, sugar and cardamom in a medium heavy-bottomed pot. Cook over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until the mixture has reduced and thickened, about 15 minutes.
2\. Add 1 1/2 cups of the coconut and a pinch of salt and continue cooking, stirring occasionally, until the coconut completely absorbs the liquid, and the mixture starts to pull away from the sides of the pot, about 10 minutes.
3\. Lower the heat to medium and continue cooking until the mixture resembles a stiff dough, about 7 minutes.
4\. Transfer the mixture to another bowl to cool. Refrigerate uncovered until completely cool and thickened, about 30 minutes. For quick cooling, place the bowl in a larger bowl filled with ice water, making sure that the ice water doesn’t reach more than three-quarters of the way up the outside of the smaller bowl. Stir the mixture occasionally to expedite the cooling process.  
5\. Once the mixture is cool enough to handle, remove and discard the cardamom seeds, then roll the mixture into 3/4-ounce balls (about 1-inch wide; about 18 total). Roll each ball between the palms of your hands until smooth and even.
6\. Put the remaining 1/2 cup coconut in a small wide bowl. Roll the balls around in the coconut until evenly coated. Refrigerate in an airtight container for up to 2 weeks.   
Cook’s Note
Panela is a hard block of raw sugar. I microwave it for 30 seconds twice, then break it into pieces. Jaggery is available in powder form. You can also use light muscovado sugar."

5 oz self-rising flour,
5 oz dark brown sugar,
5 large eggs, chilled,
kosher salt,
neutral oil,
vanilla extract,
12 Tbsp softened butter (plus more for greasing)","1\. Preheat oven to 350℉ with a rack in the center. Crack 5 large eggs into bowl of a stand mixer with a whisk attachment; mix on medium until foamy. With mixer running, gradually add brown sugar and ½ teaspoon salt. Mix on high until eggs are pale, doubled in volume, and thick, 10–12 minutes. Reduce speed to medium; gradually add 6 tablespoons oil and 1 teaspoon vanilla.
