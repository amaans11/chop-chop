        Analytics: We use analytics services (including, but not limited to, Google Analytics) to help analyze how users
        use the Site.
        Analytics services use Cookies to collect information such as how often users visit the Site and we use the
        information to improve
        our Site and Services. The analytics services' ability to use and share information collected by them is
        restricted by their terms of
        use and privacy policy, which you should refer to for more information about how these entities use this
        information.
        Location Information: If you have enabled location services on your mobile device, we may collect your location
        information to
        improve the Services we offer. If you do not want this information collected, you can disable location services
        on your device.
        Cookies: “Cookies” are small pieces of information (text files) that a website sends to your computer’s hard
        drive while you are
        viewing the website. These text files can be used by websites to make the users experience more efficient. The
        law states that we
        can store these cookies on your device if they are strictly necessary for the operation of this site. For all
        other types of cookies we
        need your permission. To that end, this site uses different types of cookies. Some cookies are placed by third
        party services that
        appear on our pages. We and some third parties may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your
        web browser)
        and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal
        and interactive
        experience on our Services and to market the Services or other products. Marketing cookies are used to track
        visitors across
        websites. The intention is to display ads that are relevant and engaging for the individual user and thereby
        more valuable for
        publishers and third party advertisers. This tracking is done on an anonymous basis and, while not an exhaustive
        list, some of the
        companies we work with are Google, AppNexus, Criteo, Rubicon, Pubmatic and DistrictM. To learn more about this
        practice,
